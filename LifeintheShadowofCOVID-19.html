<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Since the <span class="Virusname">COVID-19</span> pandemic officially began in Wuhan in mid-january, it has now rapidly spread across the globe, bringing entire economies and nations to a grinding halt. This website is a blog where individuals can post either pictures or stories of how the <span class="Virusname">COVID-19</span> outbreak has disrupted their lives and daily routines. We hope that someday, this website will be a historical record for how teh Coronavirus impacted our society, and how pandemics can impact our increasingly interconnected society in the future.</p>
<h2>Photos</h2>
